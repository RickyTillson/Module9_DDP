This app is an online tool for conducting Z-tests.
                 
It is possible to conduct 1 and 2 sample tests with the different tabs.

To run the 2-sample test the base size and the proportions (or % scores) can be adjusted. The first two inputs refer to the first sample (the blue line) and the second two adjust the second sample curve (red line).

For the 1-sample test there is a slider and base size box for the sample (green text and curve) and a seperate slider for the target to be tested again. This is plotted as a vertical black line.

Each test can be conducted as 1 or 2 tailed - if 1 tailed the direction of the test can be dictated.
                 
The significance level (p-value) can also be adjusted.

Upon entering the required details the chart should update. A visual representation should appear with text confirming all base sizes, proportions and the results of the test in terms of whether it is significant or not.
